This methodology for mitigating treatment leakage in text embeddings is robust to several challenges commonly encountered in causal inference, such as nonlinear relationships, multicollinearity, and covariate imbalance. Through the integration of random forest regression and propensity score weighting, it effectively addresses these issues and ensures reliable treatment de-biasing.

However, the model operates under key assumptions that must hold for valid causal inference:

- Complete Confounder Measurement: All variables influencing both treatment and outcome must be accurately measured and included.
  
- Proper Propensity Score Specification: The propensity score model must correctly capture the probability of treatment assignment given covariates.

- Stable Treatment Assignment: The assumption of no interference between individuals (SUTVA) is necessary to isolate causal effects.

- Overlap/Positivity: There must be a nonzero probability of receiving treatment or control across all covariate combinations.

- Ignorability: Treatment assignment must be independent of outcomes, conditional on observed covariates.

Users should ensure these assumptions are satisfied and exercise caution when applying this methodology to datasets with unmeasured confounders or substantial violations of causal assumptions.
